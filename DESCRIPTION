Description: This package provides functions to build many common (and some not 
  so common) figures for omic data analysis. Almost all plots employ a "Grammar of 
  Graphics" framework, with optional plotly output for interactive functionality.
  Methods are available for objects from limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 pipelines 
  for easy integration with Bioconductor software.
