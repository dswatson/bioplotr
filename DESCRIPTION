  pipelines

Description: This package provides functions to build many common (and some not 
  so common) figures for omic data analysis. Almost all plots employ a "Grammar 
  of Graphics" framework, with optional plotly output for interactive 
  functionality. Methods are available for objects from limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 
  pipelines for easy integration with Bioconductor software.
